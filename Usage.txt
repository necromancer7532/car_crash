-----------------------------------------HOW TO USE ----------------------------------------------

run python main.py <analysis number> from cmd

<analysis number> is the question number for which the code needs to run

you can also pass optional config if needed but by default the config in the configs folder will be used

i was not able to make my spark local working properly hence the python wrapper
